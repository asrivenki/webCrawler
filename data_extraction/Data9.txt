Java Servlet technology provides Web developers with a simple, consistent mechanism for extending the functionality of a Web server and for accessing existing business systems. Servlets are server-side Java EE components that generate responses (typically HTML pages) to requests (typically HTTP requests) from clients. A servlet can almost be thought of as an applet that runs on the server side—without a face.

The lookup service is described in the : Jini Lookup Service Specification (reggie). This service interface defines all operations that are possible on the lookup service. Clients locate services by requesting with a lookup server that implements a particular interface. Client asks the lookup server for all services that implement the particular service interface. The lookup service returns service objects for all registered services that implement the given interface. The client may invoke methods on that object in order to interact directly with the server.

A client code for a server/service is usually an API that a user application uses to interface to the server. With the help of a client API the user application does not have to know how to connect to the server to get services.

If you need to call methods between different language environments, use CORBA. With CORBA a Java client can call C++ server and/or a C++ client can call a Java server. With RMI that can not be done.
