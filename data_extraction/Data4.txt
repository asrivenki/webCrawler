However, the delegate can change over time, whereas base classes cannot. As a result, sometimes delegation is referred to as "dynamic inheritance".

The inheritance is one of the most powerful mechanism of the Object Oriented Programming. It allows the reuse of the members of a class (called the superclass or the mother class) in another class (called subclass, child class or the derived class) that inherits from it. This way, classes can be built by successive inheritance.

A normal issue in dealing with inheritance in large programs is called Fragile Base Class. It arises when subclasses of the base class make assumptions about the property (the definition of the attribute) that are outside the contract provided by the base class.

You can also have this interest using a common super class but a class can only inherit from one super class whereas it can implement several interfaces. Java does not support full orthogonal multiple inheritance. Java does not allow you to create a subclass from two classes. Multiple inheritance in C++ has complicated rules to disambiguate fields and methods inherited from multiple superclasses and types inherited multiple times. By separating interface from implementation, interfaces offer much of the benefit of multiple inheritance with less complexity and ambiguity. The price of no multiple inheritance is some code redundancy; since interfaces only define the signature of a class but cannot contain any implementation, every class inheriting an interface must provide the implementation of the defined methods, unlike in pure multiple inheritance, where the implementation is also inherited. The major benefit of that is that all Java objects can have a common ancestor. That class is called Object. When overriding methods defined in interfaces there are several rules to be followed:

Some programmers also complain about its lack of multiple inheritance, a powerful feature of several object-oriented languages, among others C++. The Java language separates inheritance of type and implementation, allowing inheritance of multiple type definitions through interfaces, but only single inheritance of type implementation via class hierarchies. This allows most of the benefits of multiple inheritance while avoiding many of its dangers. In addition, through the use of concrete classes, abstract classes, as well as interfaces, a Java language programmer has the option of choosing full, partial, or zero implementation for the object type he defines, thus ensuring maximum flexibility in application design.
