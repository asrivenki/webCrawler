The java.lang.Object.clone() method returns a new object that is a copy of the current object. Classes must implement the marker interface java.lang.Cloneable to indicate that they can be cloned.

Java has the concepts of cloning object, and the end results are similar to copy constructor. Cloning an object is faster than creation with the new keyword, because all the object memory is copied at once to destination cloned object. This is possible by implementing the Cloneable interface, which allows the method Object.clone() to perform a field-by-field copy.

Note that only mutable objects needs to be cloned. References to unchangeable objects such as String be used in the cloned object without worry.

When an object is created, a reference to the object is also created. The object can not be accessed directly in Java, only through this object reference. This object reference has a type assigned to it. We need this type when passing the object reference to a method as a parameter. Java does strong type checking.
