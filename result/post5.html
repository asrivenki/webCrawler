	I found out that the above piece of code is perfectly legal in Java. I have the following questions. ThanksAdded one more question regarding Abstract method classes.
  <p>
    public class TestClass{public static void main(String[] args) {TestClass t = new TestClass();}private static void testMethod(){abstract class TestMethod{int a;int b;int c;abstract void implementMe();}class DummyClass extends TestMethod{void implementMe(){}}DummyClass dummy = new DummyClass();}} </p>

  <li><p> LINK: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)</a> </p> <p>The main method must accept an array of String objects. By convention, it is referenced as args although any other legal identifier name can be used. Since Java 5, the main method can also use variable arguments, in the form of public static void main(String... args), allowing the main method to be invoked with an arbitrary number of String arguments. The effect of this alternate declaration is semantically identical (the args parameter is still an array of String objects), but it allows an alternative syntax for creating and passing the array. </p></li>

  <li> <p> LINK: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language)</a> </p> <p>The Java launcher launches Java by loading a given class (specified on the command line or as an attribute in a JAR) and starting its public static void main(String[]) method. Stand-alone programs must declare this method explicitly. The String[] args parameter is an array of String objects containing any arguments passed to the class. The parameters to main are often passed by means of a command line.</p></li>

  <li><p> LINK: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Print_version">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Print_version</a> </p> <p> abstract is a Java keyword. It can be applied to a class and methods. An abstract class cannot be directly instantiated. It must be placed before the variable type or the method return type. It is recommended to place it after the access modifier and after the static keyword. A non-abstract class is a concrete class. An abstract class cannot be final.</p> </li>

If additional handling is required beyond the default of writing all fields, you need to provide an implementation for methods:</p> </li>

It can be applied to a field, a method or an inner class. A static field, method or class has a single instance for the whole class that defines it, even if there is no instance of this class in the program. For instance, a Java entry point (main()) has to be static. A static method cannot be abstract. It must be placed before the variable type or the method return type.
