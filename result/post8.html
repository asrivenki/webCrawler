	Java has the ability to create classes at runtime. These classes are known as Synthetic Classes or Dynamic Proxies. See for more information. Other open-source libraries, such as and also allow you to generate synthetic classes, and are more powerful than the libraries provided with the JRE. Synthetic classes are used by AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming) libraries such as Spring AOP and AspectJ, as well as ORM libraries such as Hibernate.

  <li><p> LINK: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Annotations/Introduction">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Annotations/Introduction</a> </p> <p>One of the main forces of adding this feature to Java was the wide spread use of XML descriptors to add additional information, metadata for Java classes. Frameworks like EJB, JSF, Spring, Hibernate were heavily using external XML descriptors. The problem of those external descriptors is that those files are out of reach of the Java compiler and for that reason compiler type checking could not be used. A small spelling mistake bug in a huge XML descriptor file is hard to locate and fixed. The Java annotations on the other hand use the Java compiler type checking features, so annotation names spelling mistakes will be caught by the Java compiler.

  <li> <p> LINK: <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Reflection/Overview">https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Java_Programming/Reflection/Overview</a> </p> <p>Reflection is the mechanism by which Java exposes the features of a class during runtime, allowing Java programs to enumerate and access a class' methods, fields, and constructors as objects. In other words, there are object-based mirrors that reflect the Java object model, and you can use these objects to access an object's features using runtime API constructs instead of compile-time language constructs. Each object instance has a getClass() method, inherited from java.lang.Object, which returns an object with the runtime representation of that object's class; this object is an instance of the java.lang.Class, which in turn has methods that return the fields, methods, constructors, superclass, and other properties of that class. You can use these reflection objects to access fields, invoke methods, or instantiate instances, all without having compile-time dependencies on those features. The Java runtime provides the corresponding classes for reflection. Most of the Java classes that support reflection are in the java.lang.reflect package. Reflection is most useful for performing dynamic operations with Java â€” operations that are not hard-coded into a source program, but that are determined at run time. One of the most important aspects of reflection is dynamic class loading.</p></li>
